# Linear-Regression-and-QDA-Classification
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Begin by exploring the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and analyze the distribution of key variables such as sales, CH, and MM.

2. **Linear Regression:** Use linear regression to model the relationship between sales and predictor variables like CH and MM. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, mean squared error, and visualizations like scatter plots.

3. **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) Classification:** Apply QDA to classify sales into categories (CH or MM) based on predictor variables. Assess classification accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

4. **Comparison:** Contrast the performance of linear regression and QDA in terms of predictive accuracy, interpretability, and suitability for the specific characteristics of the dataset. Consider factors such as linearity and assumptions for regression, and decision boundaries for classification.
